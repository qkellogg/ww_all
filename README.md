This repository maintains the full dataset produced and maintained by Watershed Watch at the University of Rhode Island. Watershed Watch (WW) provides current (and historical) information on the water quality of surface water resources throughout Rhode Island, including lakes, ponds, reservoirs, rivers, streams and the marine environment.  Trained volunteer monitors take weekly measurements from spring to fall. WW emphasizes the watershed scale because the water quality of a given waterbody is a reflection of the activities upstream and in the lands and waters that surround it.  We encourage communities and shoreline residents to cooperatively manage and improve the water quality of ALL the water bodies within a watershed. In this way we can ensure that Rhode Island’s bays, estuaries, and freshwater resources remain one of the state’s great assets. More can be found at https://web.uri.edu/watershedwatch/.
The goal of this repository is to track changes made to the full dataset, which dates from 1988. While quality control is an enormous part of the work done by WW, there will always be updates necessary.
